            <summary><strong>AutoTurtle</strong></summary>
            <div class="project-box">
                <p id="caption"><strong>Developed:</strong> January 2, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>AutoTurtle</strong> was a program designed using Python's built-in Turtle module. The 
                main purpose of developing this program was to allow users, primarily those without programming 
                experience, to make use of Python Turtle by simply inputting a few values. That being said,
                AutoTurtle is simply a secondary canvas (like Microsoft Paint) for non-programmers to use. 
                The program is set in such a way that it leverages Python's built-in Turtle module to allow 
                user interactivity, enabling users to manipulate Turtle commands based on their preferences. 
                Users can choose attributes such as background color, pen color, pen size, font, font size, 
                and font style (bold, italics, underline).</p>
                <p>After selecting these options, users are prompted to enter text, which is then 
                displayed on the Turtle canvas with their assigned attributes using turtle.write(). 
                A while loop enables repeated use, clearing the canvas after each run, so users can start
                 fresh if they choose to run the program again.</p>
                <p>Default values are provided for each attribute if the user does not input a custom 
                option. Error handling ensures that the user is prompted to enter only valid responses 
                ("Yes" or "No") when deciding to rerun the program.</p>
                <p>Below, you will find a sample run of the program to help you better understand this program:</p>

                <video width="710" height="400" controls>
                    <source src="assets/videos/AutoTurtle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="assets/videos/AutoTurtle.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                </video>
                <p class="video-caption">A demonstrative run of AutoTurtle</p>

                <p>Now here, as you can see above, the sample run provides two scenarios: one where the user
                     does not do a rerun and another where it does. This shows the flexibility that 
                     AutoTurtle offers by allowing users to use it as many times as they want without closing
                      and opening it again and again.</p>

                <p>Therefore, in conclusion, <strong>AutoTurtle</strong>, while a simple Python program, exhibits both interactivity and versatility, which would make it a good secondary digital canvas, especially for non-programmers. Although its current features are strongly limited, I am working on enhancing it so as to make it more appealing and user-friendly.</p>

            <summary><strong>Network and Service Security Report</strong></summary>
            <div class="project-box">
                <p id="caption"><strong>Developed:</strong> April 2025</p>
                <p>This report was part of a group assignment I received during my freshman year at the 
                    Rochester Institute of Technology Dubai. It involved, as you can surmise from the heading
                     above, conducting secondary research on network and service security through collecting
                      data from credible online sources.</p>
                <p>Our report investigates ARP and DNS spoofing attacks through a hands-on simulation of a 
                    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Ettercap on Kali Linux. It demonstrates how an 
                    attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic by poisoning the ARP caches of 
                    both a victim machine and a router, and how DNS spoofing can redirect users to fraudulent
                     websites. The report also explains the functionality of each Ettercap command used in 
                     the attack, including the purpose of IP forwarding and the network interface 
                     configuration required to carry out such an exploit effectively.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technical process, the report highlights the real-world consequences of 
                    spoofing attacks, such as phishing, identity theft, financial fraud, and malware 
                    distribution. It also discusses practical defense mechanisms like Multi-Factor 
                    Authentication (MFA), DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), and verifying HTTPS in URLs. 
                    Supported by reliable sources, the report combines theoretical insight with practical 
                    execution to provide a well-rounded understanding of spoofing-based cyber threats and 
                    how to mitigate them.</p>
                <p>My contributions for this report included research on the following areas:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                    <li>Effects of enabling IP forward and why it is necessary.</li>
                    <li>Explanation of Ettercap commands, options, arguments used in the demonstration.</li>
                    <li>Reasoning behind the change in the router's MAC address after performing ARP cache 
                        poisoning.</li>
                    <li>Consequences of cyberattacks as well as prevention methods and situations where 
                        cyberattacks are more hazardous, such as identity theft.</li>
                </ul>
